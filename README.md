# Credit Scoring Web App

## Overview
This credit scoring web app is based on the bank scoring data provided in the Home Credit Default Risk Kaggle competition hosted by the Home Credit Group. It provides an easy way to browse relevant data for each anonymized client, as well as their credit default risk score, a value predicted using a machine learning model created using the dataset.

The app is composed of two parts:
- A backend : a Flask server giving access to the data via an API. The data is loaded from an Amazon S3 bucket.
The server stubs were generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project, using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki).  

- A frontend : a Streamlit dashboard making calls to the backend to present relevant data.
